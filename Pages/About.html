                <p>Gon Freecss (ゴン゠フリークス, Gon Furīkusu) is a Rookie Hunter and the son of Ging Freecss. Finding his father
                    is Gon's motivation in becoming a Hunter.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Gon is an athletic, rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. Also, he is not very good at
                    math. However, having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he is very good with animals. Gon is
                    an Enhancer, who are known for being simple-minded and determined. This determination and talent lead to
                    both potential allies and potential enemies trusting in him and taking his side. He has inhuman senses;
                    Gon has a heightened sense of smell almost like a dog's, he also has very good vision, as well as having
                    a very keen taste. Gon wants to become a Hunter because he wishes to find out the depths of an
                    occupation that would cause a father to choose the profession over being with his own son.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Simultaneously, his flaws lie in his temper and impulsive nature. Gon sometimes fails to think things
                    through and such actions lead to him suffering. Though possessing talent far beyond the norm for his
                    age, anytime his abilities are challenged, he feels as if he has to prove his antagonist wrong.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>He continually strives to obtain greater power, often becoming exceptionally stronger in his anger. But
                    Gon's anger also leads to some extremely reckless tendencies. When his emotions are ignited, Gon becomes
                    irrational and completely oblivious to anything else. While his will is stronger than most and he can be
                    very level-headed, this clear mind can also make him very cold at times. When Gon is cool-headed, it is
                    shown that he can think very creatively and thoughtfully to solve a problem. The prime example is in the
                    third stage of the Hunter Exam in which he can think clearly enough under heavy stress to find the way
                    to get through the locked door to the finish line with all his companions by breaking the wall to lead
                    to the finish line in time, which is the feat not even level-headed people like Kurapika or Killua can
                    think of.
