                    style="margin-top: 15px; padding-left: 128px; padding-right: 150px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Rubik-Regular; line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.5;">
                    <p>Gon is stubborn and doesn't back down, even if it means losing his life. He struggles with being
                        perceived as weak and wants to prove his worth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gon cares about fairness and won't accept losing if the loser has to forfeit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gon gives up his future potential to defeat Neferpitou. He makes a Nen contract that allows him
                        to
                        sacrifice all his Nen to kill Neferpitou. The result is his body maturing into that of a
                        muscular
                        adult with immense power and Nen aura.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Gon's choice reflects his deep emotional investment in the story and the consequences of his
                        actions.</p>

                        class="" src="../assets/GonsFriends.jpeg" alt="">
                </div>

                <p style="padding-left: 128px; font-size: 50px; font-family: Rubik-Medium; margin-top: 30px;">Caring</p>
                <div
                    style="margin-top: 15px; padding-left: 128px; padding-right: 150px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Rubik-Regular; line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.5;">
                    <p>Gon is always ready to protect his friends and avenge them. For example, he protects a Foxbear
                        cub with his own life and doesn't let Kite harm it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gon is kind, compassionate, and forgiving of everyone, even if they've wronged him. For example,
                        he chooses to heal a psychopath who had just attempted to kill him.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Gon is empathetic, taking on the burdens and duties of those around him until their goals become
                        equally as important as his own.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Gon tries to be as kind as possible until he finally makes his decision on whether someone will
                        be beneficial to him in the future. For example, he doesn't care about someone trying to kill
                        him if the person interests him.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 128px; font-size: 50px; font-family: Rubik-Medium; margin-top: 30px;">Hard Working</p>
                <div

                    <p>Gon has talent beyond the norm for his age. He is an extremely fast learner and is able to hold
                        his own as a kid who only knew the basics for a long period of time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gon listens to others and follows through on training. He practices often.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Gon has almost inhuman willpower. He is stubborn about this and never backs down even if it costs
                        him his life. He wants to prove his worth and feel that he's not weak.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Gon continually strives to obtain greater power, often becoming exceptionally stronger in his
                        anger. His anger also leads to some extremely reckless tendencies.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 128px; font-size: 50px; font-family: Rubik-Medium; margin-top: 30px;">Physically Fit</p>
                <div
                    style="margin-top: 15px; padding-left: 128px; padding-right: 150px; font-size: 20px; font-family: Rubik-Regular; line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.5;">
                    <p>Gon's training may also contribute to his physical strength. He has been trained by multiple
                        Hunters in both Nen and combat, and grew up in the mountains, where he unknowingly trained
                        through his activities.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gon's senses are so sharp due to his training and time spent in the forests of Whale Island. He
                        also has enhanced strength, durability, and endurance.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>He has superhuman abilities!</p>
