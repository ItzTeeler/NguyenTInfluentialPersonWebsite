Peer Review - The page looks amazing, its simple but the colors and the images were picked very nicely to tie in with the overall look of everything. The hero image in the beginning is a very nice touch. The only thing I would suggest is maybe removing the extra white space on the bottom of the mobile version, its just a lot of space with nothing in it. Overall the site is clean and I love that you did it on Gon.
